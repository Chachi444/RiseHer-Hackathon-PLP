feat(ui): unify theme & typography; polish About, Visibility, Resources, and reporting

- Add Roboto font import and CSS theme variables; apply consistent heading weights and focus styles.
- Improve About page: new hero (text left, framed image right), refined mission/offer layout and visual cards.
- Enhance Visibility page: full‑bleed map canvas, refined directory cards, polished story submission and Ask-an-Expert flows.
- Add harassment reporting page with evidence upload (prototype saved to localStorage).
- Revamp Resources: card grid, inline preview, download/save to localStorage, inline resource creation.
- Replace simple testimonials with a responsive carousel (3-per-view) and partners slider; accessibility and autoplay.
- Header/footer styling updates (header card layout; footer links open in same tab), and multiple small UX/accessibility fixes.
- Fix runtime/state issues and improve keyboard support and ARIA announcements.

Notes:
- Prototype behavior (file uploads, localStorage) is for demo; replace with secure server storage for production.
- No breaking API changes; visual and UX improvements only.
